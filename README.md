Noise in a communication system is undesirable or unwanted signals that get 
randomly added to the actual information carrying signal. Resultantly, it causes 
disturbances in the original signal being transmitted from one end to another. The 
presence of noise in the system causes interference in the signal being transmitted 
and this ultimately causes errors in the communication system. Practically, the 
addition of noise over the information carrying signal is an unavoidable 
phenomenon. And this interference automatically hinders the quality of the signal 
being transmitted.

Noise reduction using machine learning (ML) involves using algorithms and 
techniques to remove unwanted sounds or distortions from audio signals. There are 
several approaches to noise reduction using ML, including supervised and 
unsupervised learning methods.

## Supervised Learning: 
In supervised learning, a model is trained on labeled data, 
where each sample is a pair of a noisy audio signal and a corresponding clean audio 
signal. The model learns to map the noisy audio signal to the corresponding clean 
audio signal. This mapping can then be used to denoise new audio signals. Some 
popular supervised learning algorithms for noise reduction include deep neural 
networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural 
networks (RNNs).

## Unsupervised Learning: 
In unsupervised learning, a model is trained on unlabeled 
data, where only the noisy audio signal is available. The model learns to extract the 
underlying structure of the data and separate the signal from the noise. Some popular 
unsupervised learning algorithms for noise reduction include autoencoders, principal 
component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA).
Both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches can be used for noise 
reduction, depending on the availability of labeled data and the specific application. 
Overall, noise reduction using ML is a powerful tool that can help improve the 
quality of audio signals in various applications, including speech recognition, audio 
processing, and music production
